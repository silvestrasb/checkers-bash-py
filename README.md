# checkers-bash-py
Created this app a long time age, one of my first games. I still like it since it runs from bash command line. Just type: python3 checkers.py
and the program will run. 
controls:
* Up Arrow - move cursor up
* Down Arrow - move cursor down
* Left Arrow - move cursor left
* Right Arrow - move cursor right
* Space Key - select checker or put down the selected checker
* F2 - go back to previous move
